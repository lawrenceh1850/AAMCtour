                    This campaign is modeled off a parallel campaign advocating for virtual residency interviews in Canada (#keepCaRMSvirtual). In 2021, the Canadian Federation for Medical Students Health and Environment Adaptive Response Task Force (CFMS HEART) collected
                    over 500 signatures from medical students, residents, and physicians on an open letter to the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada (AFMC) calling for a virtual residency application process. Their efforts were successful;
                    the AFMC recently announced that the 2023 CaRMS match will be virtual. We thank CFMS HEART, and in particular, Kevin Liang, for allowing and facilitating our adaptation of their impactful petition and website. For more information,
