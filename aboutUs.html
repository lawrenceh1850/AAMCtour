                    The Interview without Harm Coalition represents a group of passionate medical students, residents, and faculty who envision a more sustainable, equitable, and efficient process of interviewing medical trainees. Organizational partners include the University
                    of California Center for Climate, Health and Equity, Medical Students for a Sustainable Future, and the Planetary Health Report Card Initiative. This campaign is modeled off of the similar Keep CARMS Virtual campaign in Canada; we
                    thank the Canadian Federation for Medical Students Health and Environment Adaptive Response Task Force (CFMS HEART) for allowing us to adapt their petition and website.
